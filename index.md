## What is email course?

Email course delivers lecture notes into your inbox directly. You learn via reading the links and tutorials on the email. You keep your own pace of learning. 

There will be around 10 emails in total for the course. You’ll receive email for new lecture automatically once a week. If you finish your lecture and would like to read the next one, you may simply click the “Send me next lecture” button to learn more on the next email.
